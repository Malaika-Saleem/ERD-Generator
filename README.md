# ERD-Generator - IBM TechXChange Hackathon
Generate structured ERD JSON from natural language using IBM Granite’s instruction-tuned AI.

In software system design, understanding how components relate to one another is essential. Whether you’re building an app, designing a service architecture, or documenting business logic, visualizing relationships between entities is key to ensuring clarity and consistency. However, this typically starts with someone — often a non-technical stakeholder — describing the system in plain language. From there, a developer or architect needs to interpret that description and manually build a structured representation, such as an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). This process is slow, error-prone, and highly dependent on how well different team members can communicate across technical boundaries.

Our project, the ERD Generator, solves this problem by using generative AI to translate natural language descriptions of a system into a structured JSON format representing the entities and their relationships.  The reason I used JSON in the result instead of a direct visual diagram is because for bigger systems, they appear quite messy and it's impossible to make minute changes you could wish to make because unlike JSON it would be uneditable. Instead of manually modeling relationships or interpreting vague documentation, users simply describe their system in plain English — and get back a precise, machine-readable structure.

The tool is designed for developers, analysts, product managers, and anyone involved in planning or documenting system architecture. The interaction is intentionally simple: users enter a description like “A user can create multiple projects; each project has tasks,” then click Generate. The result is clean, structured JSON that outlines entities, relationships, and cardinality in a format ready to use for visualization, documentation, or further development tasks.

What makes this solution creative and unique is its seamless combination of a simple user interface with the power of a large language model. At its core, the ERD Generator is powered by IBM’s Granite 3-8B Instruct model, a state-of-the-art AI model fine-tuned for instruction-following and deep language understanding. Deployed on IBM Cloud, this model interprets complex natural language descriptions and produces structured outputs with impressive accuracy.

In short, the ERD Generator bridges the gap between human thought and structured system design. It’s fast, accessible, and scalable — a practical demonstration of how AI can enhance everyday development workflows in a way judges have likely never seen before.
